The primary goal of this project is to create a robust algorithm specifically tailored for detecting fraud in the realm of International Remittance. Given the vast number of daily transactions occurring globally, especially in the context of cross-border money transfers, establishing an effective system to identify and address fraudulent activities is indispensable. Our focus centers on developing a predictive model that enhances the security of international financial transactions, ensuring a seamless and secure transfer of money over the internet across diverse regions worldwide.
